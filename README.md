# gui-debug
Attempting to link Qt GUIs with objects created and compiled in C++.



Problem with successfully calling member functions that return variablesâ€¦ can call global functions and member functions that return constants.

This problem has been debugged. Works when C++ files are compiled via msys2 vs. Cygwin.
